# DrawingsUIRebarColumnsFootingsDrawList

This is a very simple Tekla Structures application that detects if the Tekla Structures model that is currently open has any drawings. It also allows you to open said drawings.

It is based on the exercise 9 in Tekla Structures Open API documentation https://developer.tekla.com/documentation/exercise-9-browse-through-drawings-list-and-open-drawing

Apart from this, you can create a set of columns in a agiven set of coordinates. You can change their location playing around with the coordinates in some "for" loops.

You can also choose the profile and material of the columns. The columns have a stiffener.

There is no rebar, unlike the exercise in Tekla Structures website.

You can also insert pad footings, choosing their size and material.
